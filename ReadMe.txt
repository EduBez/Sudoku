Hello,

This is the code for the Qlik Development Assignment
"Solving the SUDOKU!"


This repository contains two folders:

1 - Console App

    A really simple console application build with Visual Studio 2017
    that reads the Sudoku from the file "Samurai.txt" and displays the result

2 - Windows App

    A complete Windows GUI application, build with Embarcadero RAD Studio, that
    solves any Sudoku and graphically displays the result. It also generates new
    games and is able to save puzzle result.
